Installation: 
Copy the files to the root of your SoA/ToB installation and doubleclick on setup-slandor.exe. This is a Weidu mod and will play nicely with all other Weidu mods.

Incompatibilities:
1. Deeper Shadows of Amn by Kensai Ryu. DSoA requires that Andorian is killed before the shadow dragon will trigger. In this mod, Andorian may or may not get killed.
