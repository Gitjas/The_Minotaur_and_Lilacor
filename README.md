## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

I've just played the Lilacor quest in BG2 and once again, I found myself extremely puzzled by the events in AR0418. You wander in and a minotaur promptly gets killed by four myconids. There are also three bodies lying around and no explanation whatsoever as to what has happened. Looks like another unfinished fedex, only I could find nothing beyond the minotaur's name (and even that looks suspect, as if there was a fedex planned involving minotaurs as the cre name is Slandor and the actual name is Andorian). A search with NI finds three dialogs with a reference to Andorian in them but all three dialogs are completely trashed; there is nothing to be read from them.

So to shut up my sense of frustration, I decided to add a small backstory - nothing more really than a conversation with the minotaur who reveals just what he and the three dead bodies are doing in Athkatla's sewers.

>Although it is not required for the Adrian NPC to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-adrian.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **adrian** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-adrian --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
